			<p> My name is Richlove Nkansah. I am 15 years old. I attend Bronx Health Sciences. I lived in Ghana for 8 years. While I was in Ghana I attended St. Louis Jubilee School. It has beautiful landscapes such as the Akosombo Dam, Lake Volta, and Labardi Beach. Some of my favorite places to visit while I was in Ghana was Kejetia. I loved this market place because it is a mixture of variety of dfferent foods from different cultures and traditions. I am excited to tell you all about my country and places to consider visiting when you visit Ghana.</p>
